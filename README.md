# CMS: Systematic Uncertainty on the Photon Energy Scale

 This documentation contains the following:

    1) An analyzer containing a framework which will produce the ntuples required to produce the systematic uncertainty on the photon energy scale.
    2) A set of files which will produce the relevant plots and text files containing the systematic uncertainties on the photon energy scale.

 This documentation does not contain:

    1) The edits to the CMSSW code which will store the energy deposits at every depth location within a crystal
    2) The particle gun code which describes the fixed pt particle gun specifications
